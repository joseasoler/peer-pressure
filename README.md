[Peer Pressure](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3057626086) is a mod for [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) which requires the [Ideology](https://rimworldgame.com/ideology/) DLC. With this mod, converting pawns to another ideology becomes more effective when they have a positive opinion of the proselytizer. Likewise, pawns are more likely to try to convert other pawns if they have a positive opinion of them. Shape the beliefs of your colony with ease!
